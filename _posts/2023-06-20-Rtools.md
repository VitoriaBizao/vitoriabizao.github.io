title: "Tools that I like for graphics in R"
---

In this post, I'd like to talk about two tools I like to use when creating graphics in R.

- [R graphs](https://r-charts.com/){:target="_blank"}: When programming, you cannot remember every single parameter command, so this page compiles some tutorials with basic commands for all kinds of graphs. It also includes a section on creating palettes and gradients.

- [Canva Color Wheel](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/){:target="_blank"}: What colors you use can help a lot when it comes to graphic visualization, it all about how you presented a story. This tool helps you create color palettes based on color theory.
