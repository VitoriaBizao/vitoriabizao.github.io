The `International Meeting on Plant Breeding` is a prestigious event that brings together professionals, researchers and experts in the field of plant breeding from all over the **world**. 

The meeting focuses on the **challenges** and opportunities in plant breeding to meet the growing demands of global agriculture. Each year, it addresses a relevant topic in plant breeding technology, and serves as a platform to share knowledge, discuss advances, and explore the latest trends and innovations in plant breeding.

I was part of the Communications Committee during the V and VI IMPB and I could witness the importance of these events. It was my first time to help in the organization of an **international** event and beyond the topic, I improved my communication skills so much, which was necessary to engage with the participants and the audience.

To know more about it, I suggest to follow the GVENCK [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/gvenck_esalq/){:target="_blank"}.
