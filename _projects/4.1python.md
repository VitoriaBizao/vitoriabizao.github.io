As part of the `GVENCK` group's goal to offer training to postgraduate students, we invited Dr. Alexandre Hild Aono to teach two Python courses. 

The first one, **Introduction to Python Programming**, was an introductory course with the main concepts aimed at performing tasks related to data processing. We tried to use the [Discord](https://discord.com/){:target="_blank"} platform so that the participants could have their doubts answered by the monitors and Alexandre would not have to interrupt the course and so that everyone could ask questions. But this idea did not work so well because most of the participants did not know Discord and we lost some time trying to explain it. 

So for the second course, **Introduction to Machine Learning**, which was more advanced, we had to ask the participants to have a minimal knowledge of Python as a prerequisite. And it was a great course that I highly recommend if you are thinking about working with data processing.

But since this course is not always available, I also recommend this [one](https://www.udemy.com/share/101z5c3@BXyzA2C1t_e7oNsXF7ermEE_cxNr7GsQmFG1bWhbozBrl3RG-RJqSK1I1BiYxhZN/){:target="_blank"} that I started in Udemy.
