title: Grafitando na Federal
description: Artistic transformation
---

The `Grafitando na Federal` project aimed to **transform** a large colorless wall into a cultural and artistic **expression** through graffiti. The wall, which was graffitied, was an area outside the college frequented by residents and students.

The project's proposal was to bring **life and culture** to this area, using graffiti as a visual expression. For this, a contest was held in which artists were invited to create art that represented the identity of the college and the community. The winning artist of the competition, Danilo Tenk, graffitied on the wall, bringing colors, shapes, and meanings to the place.

Grafitando na Federal aimed not only to beautify the environment but also to promote the appreciation of urban art, provide a space for cultural expression and foster the academic community's sense of belonging and identity.

Grafitando na Federal exemplifies how art and culture projects can be a powerful tool to promote inclusion, stimulate dialogue and enrich the academic environment. It is a way of conveying messages, awakening emotions, and strengthening ties between community members.
