### Epistasis and Cockerhan model
Epistasis is an effect that we must take into account when we are trying to understand the genotypic part of a polygenic trait. First, we try to understand at the level of a single locus, its additive and dominance effects. But as the name implies, the polygenic trait is controlled by several genes, so epistasis measures the interaction between genes from different loci.
