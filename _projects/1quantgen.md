title: Quantitative Genetics Videos
description: Heredity, Variation, Selection
---

Videos made for the Quantitative Genetics discipline, of the post-graduate program in Genetics and Plant Breeding at ESALQ/USP, administered by professor Antonio Augusto Franco Garcia. You can find my annotations of all classes [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/VitoriaBizao/Genetica_Quantitativa/blob/main/QuantGen.html){:target="_blank"}, like the videos, those are in Portuguese. In English I recommend the Felipe Ferr√£o material, and is more complete than mine. You can access it [here](https://lfelipe-ferrao.github.io/class/quantGenetic/){:target="_blank"}.

### Epistasis and Cockerhan model
Epistasis is an effect that we must take into account when we are trying to understand the genotypic part of a polygenic trait. First, we try to understand at the level of a single locus, its additive and dominance effects. But as the name implies, the polygenic trait is controlled by several genes, so epistasis measures the interaction between genes from different loci.
