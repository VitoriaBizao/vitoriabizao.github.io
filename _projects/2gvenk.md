In 2020, I had the incredible opportunity to join the `GVENCK`. I initially joined GVENCK as a member of the **logistics** commission. Although the pandemic limited our presidential activities, it did not deter our **enthusiasm** and commitment to contribute to the field of plant genetics and breeding.

Later, I was offered the coordinator role for the **Communication Commission**, which opened up a world of opportunities for me. In this new role, I had the privilege of overseeing the creation of art materials for promoting events and seminars through social media and ensuring the smooth transmission of sessions via Zoom and YouTube. Additionally, we created weekly posts aimed at increasing public engagement. The experience of being both a member and coordinator of GVENCK has been invaluable to me. I've gained insights into social media management, leadership, planning, and, more significantly, building a career in plant breeding – skills that I will always carry with me.

I highly recommend GVENCK to all postgraduate students seeking to expand their network and **connect** with some of the brightest minds in the field. The opportunity to collaborate with such a dedicated and talented group has been an absolute pleasure. I feel grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this incredible community. I wish the best of luck to all future members and look forward to witnessing the continued growth and success of the group. To witness their success with me and be updated with their events check out their website [here](https://sites.usp.br/gvenck/){:target="_blank"}.

So here are some tools that I discovered and learned, that helped me in my GVENK activities and that I recommend:

- [Canva](https://www.canva.com/){:target="_blank"}: amazing design tool that I used to create the visual materials for promoting events.
- [Streamyard](https://streamyard.com){:target="_blank"}: it's a streaming platform. We use this one to transmit our webinars, you can watch it [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQgoXUJx1_7leGU4TIrJD094fssUH5WcV){:target="_blank"}.
- [Publer](https://publer.io){:target="_blank"}: this one is the best social media management tool that I found. You can schedule & analyze posts. It let you synchronize with your canva account, create threads on Twitter, and now it has a AI. I love it. 
- [Git](https://github.com){:target="_blank"}: It's a platform of codes version control. We used to maintain the gvenk website.
- [OBS studio](https://obsproject.com/){:target="_blank"}: it's a streaming and recording program. Actually, I used this one to make the quantitative genetics videos. But, I still recommend.
- html: had to learn a little big to update the website.
