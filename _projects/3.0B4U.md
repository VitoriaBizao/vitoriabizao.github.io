B4U is a competitive annual program that provides 1 on 1 mentoring for students and post-doctoral researchers. This mentee-driven program offers mentees with _soft skill coaching_ and _career development_ advice. Each mentee is paired with an industry scientist as mentor to generate professional development goals for career development and they work together towards the completion of goals. Bayer provides structured content on soft skill development, an understanding of industry working environment, and expectations of an influential scientist.
