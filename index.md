Hi there! My name is _Vit처ria Biz찾o Murakami_ and I'm a biotechnologist by the [Federal University of S찾o Carlos](https://www.araras.ufscar.br/). Currently I'm a master Student in Genetics and Plant Breeding at [University of S찾o Paulo](https://www.esalq.usp.br/), working with Genotype-by-Environment Interaction at the [Statistical Genetics Lab](https://statgen-esalq.github.io/). 

I really enjoy reading, specially thrillers. You can check out what I'm reading [here](https://www.skoob.com.br/perfil/vitoriabizao). And what I'm watching [here](https://tvtime.com/r/2wvUP).

[Gradfolio](https://github.com/jitinnair1/gradfolio){:target="_blank"} is a responsive, dark-mode ready Jekyll theme designed keeping academia in mind. The easiest way to install the theme is to fork it using GitHub. Check the README file for [instructions](https://github.com/jitinnair1/gradfolio#installation){:target="_blank"}.

If you want to use this space to write your biography here, edit the `index.md` file. You can put a picture in, too. Rename your picture to `profile.png` and put it in the `assets/images/` folder.

The social-icons footer can be used to link profiles from GitHub, OrcID and ReasearchGate aprart form the usual Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook. You can add your user ID in the `_config.yml` file to link your accounts.

PS: If you liked the theme, do star it on GitHub!
