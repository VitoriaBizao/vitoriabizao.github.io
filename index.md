Hi there! My name is `Vit처ria Biz찾o Murakami` and I'm the daughter of genetics professors, so I've always had contact and interest with the area. I got a bachelor degree in biotechnology by the [Federal University of S찾o Carlos](https://www.araras.ufscar.br/){:target="_blank"}. During my undergraduate my advisor, [Rodrigo Gazaffi](https://www.ppgpvba.ufscar.br/pt-br/o-programa/docentes/prof-dr-rodrigo-gazaffi){:target="_blank"}, presented me to the statistical genetics world. This drove me to where I'm today. Currently I'm a master Student in Genetics and Plant Breeding at [University of S찾o Paulo](https://www.esalq.usp.br/){:target="_blank"}, working with *Genotype-by-Environment Interaction* at the [Statistical Genetics Lab](https://statgen-esalq.github.io/) under the supervisor of [Antonio Augusto Garcia](http://augustogarcia.me/){:target="_blank"}. You can read more about my academic work under the [CV](../cv/) tab.

In my free time enjoy reading, specially thrillers. You can check out what I'm reading [here](https://www.skoob.com.br/perfil/vitoriabizao){:target="_blank"}. Also, I'm a television enthusiastic, I really like to understand how the industry work and the productions backstage. See what I'm watching [here](https://tvtime.com/r/2wvUP){:target="_blank"}.
