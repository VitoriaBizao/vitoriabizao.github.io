Hi there! My name is `Vit처ria Biz찾o Murakami` and I'm the daughter of genetics professors and I've always had contact with and interest in the area. So, I got a bachelor degree in biotechnology by the [Federal University of S찾o Carlos](https://www.araras.ufscar.br/). During my undergraduate time I was presented to the statistical genetics world, which drove me to where I'm today. Currently I'm a master Student in Genetics and Plant Breeding at [University of S찾o Paulo](https://www.esalq.usp.br/), working with Genotype-by-Environment Interaction at the [Statistical Genetics Lab](https://statgen-esalq.github.io/). You can read more about my academic work under the [Projects](../_pages/projects/) tab.

In my free time enjoy reading, specially thrillers. You can check out what I'm reading [here](https://www.skoob.com.br/perfil/vitoriabizao). Also, I'm a television enthusiastic, I really like to understand how the industry work and the productions backstage. See what I'm watching [here](https://tvtime.com/r/2wvUP).
