Hi there! My name is `Vit처ria Biz찾o Murakami` and I'm the daughter of genetics professors, so I've always had contact and interest with the field. I have a Bachelor's degree in biotechnology from the [Federal University of S찾o Carlos](https://www.araras.ufscar.br/){:target="_blank"}. During my undergraduate studies, my advisor, [Rodrigo Gazaffi](https://www.ppgpvba.ufscar.br/pt-br/o-programa/docentes/prof-dr-rodrigo-gazaffi){:target="_blank"}, introduced me to the world of statistical genetics. This led me to where I'm at today. Currently, I'm a Master student in Genetics and Plant Breeding at the [University of S찾o Paulo](https://www.esalq.usp.br/){:target="_blank"}, working on *genotype interactions* in the [Statistical Genetics Lab](https://statgen-esalq.github.io/){:target="_blank"} under the supervision of [Antonio Augusto Garcia](http://augustogarcia.me/){:target="_blank"}. You can read more about my academic work in the [CV](../cv/) tab.

In my spare time I like to read, especially thrillers. You can check out what I'm reading [here](https://www.skoob.com.br/perfil/vitoriabizao){:target="_blank"}. I'm also a television enthusiast, I really like to understand how the industry work and the productions behind the scenes. See what I'm watching [here](https://tvtime.com/r/2wvUP){:target="_blank"}.
